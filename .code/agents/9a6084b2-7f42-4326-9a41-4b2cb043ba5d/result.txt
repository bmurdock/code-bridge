## Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Functionality Implementation

#### Milestone M1: VS Code Bridge MVP
1. **Implement `/chat` endpoint**:
   - Parse request body for prompt and model selection parameters
   - Use `vscode.lm.sendChatRequest()` with proper parameters
   - Handle model selection using `vscode.lm.selectModels()` with filters
   - Return JSON response with completion result

2. **Implement `/models` endpoint**:
   - Enhance model discovery with proper filtering
   - Return complete model metadata (id, vendor, family, version, maxInputTokens)

3. **Add comprehensive logging**:
   - Implement different log levels (error, warn, info, debug)
   - Log request lifecycle (start, completion, errors)
   - Log configuration changes and server start/stop events

#### Milestone M2: MCP Sidecar MVP
1. **Complete tool implementations**:
   - Finalize `copilot.listModels` with proper filtering
   - Implement `copilot.chat` with full parameter support
   - Return proper MCP response formats

2. **Add error handling**:
   - Catch and format bridge errors as MCP text responses
   - Prevent sidecar crashes on bridge failures
   - Add timeout handling for bridge requests

### Phase 2: Advanced Features

#### Milestone M3: Streaming, Cancellation, Security
1. **Implement streaming support**:
   - VS Code extension: Use `vscode.lm.sendChatRequest()` streaming capability
   - MCP sidecar: Forward chunks as incremental tool results
   - Handle partial responses properly in both components

2. **Enhance cancellation handling**:
   - VS Code extension: Tie HTTP connection close to `CancellationTokenSource`
   - MCP sidecar: Propagate cancellation signals through AbortController
   - Verify interruption of Copilot generation on client cancellation

3. **Security enhancements**:
   - Verify localhost-only binding cannot be bypassed
   - Test bearer token authentication thoroughly
   - Add request validation and sanitization

#### Milestone M4: DX Polish and Testing
1. **Developer experience improvements**:
   - Add comprehensive logging with configurable levels
   - Implement graceful shutdown procedures
   - Add health check endpoint

2. **Documentation and samples**:
   - Create usage documentation for both components
   - Provide CLI integration examples
   - Document configuration options

3. **Testing implementation**:
   - Add unit tests for both components
   - Implement integration tests with Codex CLI
   - Add stress tests for concurrency limits
   - Test error scenarios and edge cases

## Dependencies and Sequencing

### Critical Path
1. **VS Code Extension Core** → **MCP Sidecar Basic Tools** → **Streaming Implementation** → **Full Integration Testing**
2. **Model Discovery** and **Chat Completion** can be developed in parallel
3. **Cancellation** and **Streaming** features are interdependent and should be implemented together

### External Dependencies
1. **VS Code LM API** - Requires GitHub Copilot extension for actual functionality
2. **MCP SDK** - Provides the foundation for the sidecar implementation
3. **Codex CLI** - Required for end-to-end testing and integration verification

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
1. **VS Code Extension**:
   - Mock `vscode.lm` API for testing request handling
   - Test authorization logic with various header configurations
   - Validate request body parsing and size limits
   - Test concurrency limiting under various loads

2. **MCP Sidecar**:
   - Mock HTTP responses from bridge for tool testing
   - Test parameter validation with zod schemas
   - Verify error handling and response formatting
   - Test cancellation signal propagation

### Integration Testing
1. **End-to-End Flows**:
   - Test model discovery from CLI through sidecar to extension
   - Verify chat completion flows with various model parameters
   - Test streaming responses with large completions
   - Validate cancellation behavior

2. **Security Testing**:
   - Verify localhost-only binding enforcement
   - Test authentication with valid/invalid tokens
   - Validate request size limits

### Performance Testing
1. **Load Testing**:
   - Test concurrency limits under sustained load
   - Measure response times under various conditions
   - Test back-pressure handling with queue overflow scenarios

## Recommended Tooling Updates

### Development Tooling
1. **Add linting**:
   - Configure ESLint with TypeScript support
   - Add Prettier for code formatting consistency
   - Integrate with CI pipeline

2. **Testing Framework**:
   - Add Vitest for unit testing (fast, Vite-native)
   - Add test coverage reporting
   - Set up CI pipeline with automated testing

3. **Build Improvements**:
   - Consider esbuild or Vite for faster builds
   - Add source map support for debugging
   - Implement watch mode for development

### Developer Experience
1. **Documentation**:
   - Add JSDoc comments to all public APIs
   - Create comprehensive README with setup instructions
   - Document troubleshooting common issues

2. **Debugging Support**:
   - Add debug logging option
   - Provide VS Code launch configurations for debugging both components
   - Create example configurations for various scenarios

3. **Release Process**:
   - Implement semantic versioning
   - Add changelog generation
   - Consider automated publishing workflows

This plan provides a clear path to completing the Copilot Bridge project with proper sequencing of work, identification of dependencies, and a comprehensive approach to testing and developer experience.
