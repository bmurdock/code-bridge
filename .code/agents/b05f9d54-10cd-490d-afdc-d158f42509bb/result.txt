# **Title**

Copilot Bridge for Codex CLI via VS Code LM API and MCP Sidecar

# **Overview**

This project delivers a bridge allowing the OpenAI Codex CLI (or any MCP-capable client) to use GitHub Copilot models exposed through VS Code’s Language Model (LM) API. The design introduces a two-part architecture: a VS Code extension that exposes the LM API over a local HTTP endpoint, and a lightweight MCP sidecar server that maps Codex CLI tool requests to that endpoint. This enables developers to interact with Copilot models from a generic CLI environment while preserving consent, authentication, and billing flows managed by VS Code and GitHub.

# **Objectives**

* Enable Codex CLI to use GitHub Copilot models through a compliant bridge.
* Preserve VS Code’s LM API consent, authentication, and vendor restrictions.
* Provide a secure, robust local interface (127.0.0.1) for MCP clients.
* Support model discovery and metadata (id, vendor, family, version, token limits).
* Ensure streaming, cancellation, and error handling are correctly surfaced to CLI users.
* Deliver maintainable, modular architecture (VS Code extension + MCP sidecar).

# **Scope**

* Implementation of a VS Code extension (“Bridge”) exposing LM API via HTTP.

# Architecture Plan

## Workstreams

1. **VS Code LM Bridge Extension**
   - Provide HTTP interface around `vscode.lm` API: GET `/models`, POST `/chat`.
   - Configuration surface via `lmBridge.port`, `lmBridge.authToken`, `lmBridge.autoStart`.
   - Local-only binding with optional bearer auth.
   - Concurrency gating and request size limits.
   - Log channel with level support.
   - Graceful shutdown and cancellation tied to HTTP connections.

2. **MCP Copilot Sidecar**
   - MCP server exposing `copilot.chat` and `copilot.listModels` tools.
   - Streams responses through Codex CLI using incremental tool outputs.
   - Bridges cancellation and errors without crashing.
   - Config via environment (`LM_BRIDGE_URL`, auth token, timeouts).

3. **Codex CLI Integration Assets**
   - Provide instructions and templates for registering MCP server.

**Structuring detailed implementation plan**

I'm organizing a comprehensive plan covering overview, dependencies, milestones, and implementation steps. It will highlight streaming, cancellation, concurrency control, security, logging, and testing with clear task breakdowns and tooling recommendations to ensure a thorough and actionable roadmap.
[2025-09-19T03:25:48] codex

**Implementation Plan**
- Establish shared TypeScript tooling first: align `tsconfig` targets, add `eslint` + `@typescript-eslint` (dry run before `--fix`), set up `vitest` workspaces with Node 18 environment, and wire `npm run test` / `npm run lint` at root. Introduce a lightweight mock of the VS Code LM API (shim in `packages/bridge-extension/src/test/fixtures/`) so bridge logic can be unit-tested without VS Code. Document environment variables (`LM_BRIDGE_*`) in `README.md` and `docs/architecture.md`.
- Deliver VS Code bridge core: refactor `BridgeServer` to separate HTTP plumbing from LM invocation, parse `/chat` payloads with `zod`, and implement `/models` caching with refresh on demand. Add concurrency guard rejection metrics, structured logging with log levels, and graceful shutdown via `context.subscriptions`. Implement cancellation by tying `req.on('close')` and `vscode.CancellationTokenSource`. Enforce 32 KiB limit with informative error bodies and 413 status. Harden security with strict `127.0.0.1` bind, optional bearer auth, and audit logging that redacts prompts.
- Add streaming & error propagation in the bridge: call `vscode.lm.sendRequest` with `stream: true`, marshal streamed segments (text, references, tool calls) into newline-delimited JSON frames or SSE; flush as chunks and terminate with a sentinel event. Surface provider errors verbosely but safely (HTTP 502/503). Propagate provider cancellation and timeouts back to HTTP clients, logging duration and outcome per request.
- Enhance MCP sidecar: wrap `fetch` with streaming support using `ReadableStream`/`for await` and forward chunks via `context.write` to emit incremental MCP tool outputs; fall back to buffered mode if streaming disabled. Share Zod schemas between tools, support optional model selection, and convert bridge 4xx/5xx into structured MCP errors instead of throwing. Ensure MCP cancellation hooks abort the HTTP request and emit a `partial` final chunk noting cancellation.
- Build test suites: bridge unit tests for `handleChat`, auth, body limits, streaming chunk formatting (use mocked LM provider). Integration tests spinning up the HTTP server with a fake LM to verify `/models`, `/chat` (streaming, cancellation, 413, 503). Sidecar tests using `vitest` + `msw`/`nock` to simulate bridge responses and validate streaming + error handling. Add end-to-end script (Vitest or Node harness) launching both bridge and sidecar to ensure Codex MCP contract is satisfied; include regression test for CLI cancellation.
- Polish developer experience & docs: add `npm run dev --workspace code-bridge-extension` with `vsce` or `@vscode/test-electron` harness for manual verification, plus `npm run dev --workspace copilot-mcp-sidecar` to run sidecar with watch mode. Update `docs/architecture.md` with detailed sequence diagrams for streaming and cancellation. Provide onboarding instructions in `README.md` for configuring Codex CLI profiles and capturing logs. Log rotation or size guard to keep `LogOutputChannel` manageable. Conclude with checklist aligning to PRD acceptance criteria and track open questions (model families, auto-start defaults, observability) in `project.prd.md`.

**Milestone Sequencing**
- M0 (Tooling & Docs): shared configs, lint/test scaffolding, documentation refresh.
- M1 (Bridge MVP): `/models`, `/chat` basic handling, configuration wiring, logging baseline.
- M2 (Sidecar MVP): MCP tools, synchronous forwarding, error handling.
- M3 (Streaming & Cancellation): streaming pipeline integration on both sides, cancellation propagation, concurrency/back-pressure tuning.
- M4 (Security & DX): bearer auth, logging polish, VS Code output improvements, CLI instructions, finalize tests and acceptance validation.

**Dependencies & Follow-ups**
- Confirm `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` exposes incremental `context.write` API version used; upgrade if needed.
- Verify VS Code LM API streaming contract for Copilot models and adjust chunk serialization accordingly.
- Decide on default auto-start behavior and model family prioritization with product stakeholders; update configs/test fixtures once resolved.
- Consider optional observability endpoint after core goals, but stub metrics hooks to ease future expansion.

**Next Steps**
1. Align on streaming serialization format (NDJSON vs SSE) and document contract between bridge and sidecar before implementation begins.
2. Kick off tooling milestone (lint/test setup, mock LM harness) to unblock unit tests for subsequent milestones.
